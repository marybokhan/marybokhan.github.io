## Why Create a Personal Web Page?

In today's digital age, having a personal web page is essential for any professional, especially for developers. Here are a few reasons why I decided to create my own web page:

1. **Showcase my skills**: A personal web page allows me to demonstrate my coding abilities, design sense, and understanding of various tools and technologies.
2. **Build an online presence**: An online portfolio helps me stand out and increases my visibility to potential employers, clients, and collaborators.
3. **Document my learning**: Writing about my experiences, projects, and the technology I use enables me to reflect on my learning process and improve as a developer.
4. **Connect with the community**: Sharing my work and ideas online opens up opportunities for networking and collaboration with other developers and professionals.

## Technology Stack

I decided to use the following technologies:

### Zola

[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) is a fast and modern static site generator written in Rust. I chose Zola because:

- It's fast and efficient, ensuring quick build times and optimal site performance;
- It provides a simple and easy-to-understand templating language for creating custom layouts;
- It comes with built-in support for syntax highlighting, making it perfect for showcasing code snippets;
- The strong community and extensive documentation make it easy to get started and troubleshoot issues.

### GitHub Pages

I decided to host my website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because:

- It's reliable, secure, and offers excellent performance;
- It's free for personal use and provides seamless integration with GitHub repositories;
- It supports custom domain names, allowing me to create a professional-looking URL;
- Its strong connection to the developer community makes it a popular choice for hosting personal web pages and portfolios.

### GitHub Actions

To automate the deployment process, I used [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). This decision was based on the following reasons:

- GitHub Actions offers a powerful and flexible way to automate workflows, including deployment, testing, and more;
- It's fully integrated with GitHub, making it easy to use and maintain;
- It supports a wide range of community-contributed actions, which can be easily adapted and reused for various projects;
- Using GitHub Actions demonstrates my proficiency in modern DevOps practices.

## Conclusion

Creating my website has been a rewarding journey, allowing me to enhance my skills as a developer and designer.
