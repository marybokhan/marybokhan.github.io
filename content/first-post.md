# My First Post: The Journey of Creating My Personal Web Page

Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to share the story behind the creation of my personal web page, the technology I used, and the reasons for choosing these particular tools. As an iOS Engineer, having an online presence is crucial for showcasing my skills, networking, and keeping up with the latest trends in the industry. So let's dive into the journey of creating my personal web page!

## Why Create a Personal Web Page?

In today's digital age, having a personal web page is essential for any professional, especially for developers. Here are a few reasons why I decided to create my own web page:

1. **Showcase my skills**: A personal web page allows me to demonstrate my coding abilities, design sense, and understanding of various tools and technologies.
2. **Build an online presence**: An online portfolio helps me stand out and increases my visibility to potential employers, clients, and collaborators.
3. **Document my learning**: Writing about my experiences, projects, and the technology I use enables me to reflect on my learning process and improve as a developer.
4. **Connect with the community**: Sharing my work and ideas online opens up opportunities for networking and collaboration with other developers and professionals.

## Technology Stack: Zola, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Actions

For my personal web page, I decided to use the following technologies:

### Zola

[Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) is a fast and modern static site generator written in Rust. I chose Zola because:

- It's fast and efficient, ensuring quick build times and optimal site performance.
- It provides a simple and easy-to-understand templating language (Tera) for creating custom layouts.
- It comes with built-in support for syntax highlighting, making it perfect for showcasing code snippets.
- The strong community and extensive documentation make it easy to get started and troubleshoot issues.

### GitHub Pages

I decided to host my website on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) because:

- It's reliable, secure, and offers excellent performance.
- It's free for personal use and provides seamless integration with GitHub repositories.
- It supports custom domain names, allowing me to create a professional-looking URL.
- Its strong connection to the developer community makes it a popular choice for hosting personal web pages and portfolios.

### GitHub Actions

To automate the deployment process, I used [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). This decision was based on the following reasons:

- GitHub Actions offers a powerful and flexible way to automate workflows, including deployment, testing, and more.
- It's fully integrated with GitHub, making it easy to use and maintain.
- It supports a wide range of community-contributed actions, which can be easily adapted and reused for various projects.
- Using GitHub Actions demonstrates my proficiency in modern DevOps practices.

## Conclusion

Creating my personal web page has been a rewarding journey, allowing me to showcase my skills and connect with the developer community. By using Zola, GitHub Pages, and GitHub Actions, I've built a fast, secure, and easily maintainable website. I'm excited to share my work, ideas, and experiences with you all. Stay tuned for more posts on my projects, challenges, and learning experiences in the world of iOS development!
